# xmit-admin-customizer
WP Admin customizer for Transmit Studio sites

* Admin bar indicates current environment by lighting up in different colors.
* Removes comments icon from admin bar because who uses comments anyway. Plus it wastes space.
* Stops saying "Howdy" to the user because we're not all hayseeds like Matt Mullenweg.
* Negates auto-update, because who can trust plugin developers?
